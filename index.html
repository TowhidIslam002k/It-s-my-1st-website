            <h1> A Motivation To Everyone</h1>
            <p>Sometimes you can try so hard at something.
              Sometimes you can be so prepared, and still fail.
              And when every time you fail, it's painful. It causes sadness.
              And especially as I saw last night, it causes disappointment.
              I've often said a man's character is not judged after he celebrates a victory but by what he does when his back is against the wall.
              So no matter how great the setback, how severe the failure, you never give up.
              you pick yourself up,  you brush yourself off, you push forward, you move on, you adapt, you overcome. That is what I believe</p>
